'NOTES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 1) You can use any name you like for you views, but be descriptive and consistent
 2) You can use your working code from assignment 5 for much of this assignment
 3) You must use the BASIC views for each table after they are created in Question 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'

-- Question 1 (5% pts): How can you create BACIC views to show data from each table in the database.
-- NOTES: 1) Do not use a *, list out each column!
--        2) Create one view per table!
--		  3) Use SchemaBinding to protect the views from being orphaned!
Create View vCategories
With SchemaBinding
	As
		Select CategoryID, CategoryName
			From dbo.Categories;
go
Create View vProducts
with SchemaBinding
	As
		Select ProductID, ProductName, CategoryID, UnitPrice
			From dbo.Products;
go
Create view vEmployees
with SchemaBinding
	As
		Select EmployeeID, EmployeeFirstName, EmployeeLastName, ManagerID
			From dbo.Employees;
go
Create view vinventories
with SchemaBinding
	As
		Select InventoryID, InventoryDate, EmployeeID, ProductID, [Count]
			From dbo.inventories;
go

-- Question 2 (5% pts): How can you set permissions, so that the public group CANNOT select data 
-- from each table, but can select data from each view?
Deny Select On Categories To public;
Deny Select On Products To public;
Deny Select On Employees To public;
Deny Select On Inventories To public;
go
Grant Select On vCategories To Public;
Grant Select On vProducts To Public;
Grant Select On vEmployees To Public;
Grant Select On vInventories To Public;

		Inner Join vProducts as P
			On C.CategoryID = P.CategoryID
		Order By 1,2,3;

-- and Inventory Counts on each Inventory Date?
-- Order the results by the Product, Date, and Count!
Create View vInventoriesByProductsByDates
As
	Select Top 1000000
